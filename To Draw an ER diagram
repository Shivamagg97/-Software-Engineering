Draw an ER diagram for the following problem:
The latest cab services agency in the city has approached you to develop a Cab Management System for them. They would be using this software to efficiently manage and track different cabs that are operated by them.
Cabs are solely owned by the agency. They hire people in contracts to drive the cabs. A cab can be uniquely identified by, like any other vehicle in the country, its license plate. 
A few different categories of cars are available from different manufacturers. And a few of them are AC cars.
Cab drivers are given a identification card while joining. The ID card contains his name, permanent address, phone number, date of joining, duration of contract. 
Also, an unique alphanumeric code is assigned to each number.
The agency provides service from 8 AM to 8 PM. Whenever any passenger books a cab, an available cab is allocated for him. 
The booking receipt given to the passenger contains the car #, source and destination places. Once he reaches the destination, he signs on a duplicate copy of the receipt and gives back to the driver. 
Driver must submit this duplicate copy signed by the passenger at the agency for confirmation.
To evaluate their quality of service, the agency also wants a (optional) customer satisfaction survey, where passengers can provide feedback about their journey through the agency's website.
